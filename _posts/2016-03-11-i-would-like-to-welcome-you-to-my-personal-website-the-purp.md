I would like to welcome you to my personal website. The purpose of this website is to show some of the training and work that I have done through out the years. 

I grew up in the west suburbs of Chicago with my mom and two sisters. I attended many different schools from elementary through high school. We moved fairly often as we grew up barely making it sometimes. My mother did a great job keeping all of together and I am extremely proud of her for that. I guess I learned a great deal from my mother as she has always worked, even still to this day. 

My first job was as a mechanic with Jiffy Lube, at the age of 16\. It did not last very long, because my cousin decided to squirt oil at me, and I like a fool, grabbed the oil gun and started squirting him back. This was a big mistake, because I was not yet trained on the operation of the oil gun and couldn't turn it off. Needless to say, It got all over everything. I was immediately fired and I learned a valuable lesson that day.

Throughout the next couple of years I had landscaping, factory, and various other jobs assembling things in the manufacturing industry. I eventually found my way to operator of several machines. I operated lathes, mills, punch-presses, saws, etc. These jobs were fun, but my interest quickly  started to shift. I was still searching at that time and still attending high school. 

I moved to Texas, and attended high school at Carrizo Springs High. I lived with my Uncle and his family. The reason I moved was my decision. I saw I was struggling with school and had to many distractions and so my uncle took me in. He really impacted my life. I learned so much from him.

Among all the school I attended throughout all the years, I mean I must have went to 3 elementary schools, a couple junior highs, A few High schools. I never quit and I graduated, and brought back a high school diploma to my mom. It was a great achievement. As the oldest child I always felt that I needed to set the example for my smaller sisters.
